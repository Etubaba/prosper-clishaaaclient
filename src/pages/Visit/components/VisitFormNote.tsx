        Why is a website visit so important?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4 font-light'>
        The mere act of visiting a website, whether a user enters the URL
        directly or uses a bookmark, can also be significant for Google ranking.
        Here are some reasons why this can be important:
      </p>

      <p className='mb-4 font-light'>
        1. Brand Awareness: When users visit a website directly, it often
        indicates a certain level of brand awareness. If a website is frequently
        accessed directly, it demonstrates that users are already familiar with
        the brand or content and actively seek out that particular website.
      </p>

      <p className='mb-4 font-light'>
        2. Repeat Traffic: When users visit a website directly, it may suggest
        that they have visited the website before and want to revisit it. Repeat
        traffic signals to Google that the website is of interest to users and
        provides some value.
      </p>

      <p className='mb-4 font-light'>
        3. User Experience: Google also considers user experience when
        evaluating websites. When users visit a website directly, it indicates
        that they perceive the website as trustworthy and relevant. This can
        have a positive impact on the ranking.
      </p>

      <p className='mb-4 font-light'>
        4. Time on Site: If users visit a website directly and spend a
        significant amount of time on the page, it can increase the dwell time.
        A longer dwell time is often seen as a positive signal by Google and can
        influence the ranking.
      </p>

      <p className='mb-4 font-light'>
        However, it is important to note that direct visits alone are not
        sufficient to achieve a high ranking in search results. Google takes
        into account a variety of factors, including relevance, content quality,
        backlinks, and more. Nonetheless, direct visits to a website can
        contribute to strengthening brand trust and improving user experience,
        ultimately positively affecting the ranking.
